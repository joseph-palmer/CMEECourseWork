the first line which details the sequence name, the second pipe removes new line 
characters, the final pipe counts the number of characters in the sequence left.

#4 tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o "ATCG" | wc -l
Description: This counts the number of matches of sequence "ATGC". The first 2 pipes
are the same as for answer 3 (see above), the 3rd pipe uses grep to return each instance
