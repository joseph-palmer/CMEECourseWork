#### Overview
* The data for the project can be found in: __Data/__
* The code for this project can be found in: __Code/__ & __Notebooks/__  
* The results and figures for this project are found in: __Results/__  
* The writeup can be found in: __WriteUp/__  

The above folders contain everything required to run the project.

The folder __Testing/__ and its subfolders contains testing scripts that are informative to me whilst working things out. These folders are not critical to the project running but store some working outs of methods before I impliment them in the main code under version control.

__Note:__  
Part of the objective of this project is to produce software to impliment a sum of exponentials analysis through maximum likelihood. This software is writen in python and will be a python package with an interface for R and a GUI. The ongoing code for this package is in __Code/mletools_V1/__. The script mletester.py in Code runs a test of the package.

#### How to recreate analysis.  

All code to recreate the analysis is in Jupyter Notebooks in the directory __Notebooks/__.  To recreate the figures you will need to download this repository to your local machine. Then run the notebooks. Paths to save files have been commented out in places so these will need un-commenting. Further, you will need to look at the write up figures in order to see what variables to use to recreate the exact results of this project. These are outlined in the results section and in the captions of each figure.
