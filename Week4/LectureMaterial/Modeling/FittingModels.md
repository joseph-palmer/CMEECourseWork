# Fitting models to data in ecology and evolution

## Mechanistic Vs. Phenomenological models

__What does modelling data mean?__ Modeling data can be divided into two main aspects. These are part of a scale rather than diposed.

### Mechanistic models aim to explain the process of mechanisms underlying patterns or phenomena in empirical data. These models have a theoretical basis.
### The Phenomenological model establishes the existance of statistically significant, non-random patterns in empirical data. They make no assumptions about the processes or mechanisms. They lack a theoretical basis.

Why would you do each of these instead of the other? what is the link between these two? They both play a slightly different role.

Takes Hare and Lynx dynamics. Mechanistic model would say the Lynx-Hare Cycle is driven by denisty dependent population growth in hares. The Phenomenological model would say the cycles have a significant asynchrony (period shift) of xx years.

### Its not really one or the other, they both play a role. Phenomenological model-fitting reveals patterns in data that generate hypotheses. These can be tested by further modeling. The mechanistic model tries to validate a mechanistic model that can explain the observed Phenomenological pattern and generate more accurate mechanistic hypotheses.

### Most ecological studies are Phenomenological. _Why?_ Because we are still establishing the existance of patterns.
