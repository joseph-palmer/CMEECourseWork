# A normal distribution

In addition to a bell curve for histograms, the mean, median and mode should be all relatively similar. As the skew	of the distribution increases, these three measures diverge.

# Centrality
mean, median and mode.
# spread
Range, variance.
Combined, Centrality and spread gives us a description of our data.

What is variance?

xi = x at a particular observation number.
x^ (also has a line above it) if the mean of x.

The variance formula goes through all i's of our observation and subtracts the
mean. It then takes a sum, squared it and then subtracts it from the sample size.
A high variance means a greater spread, a lower variance means a smaller spread.

What is standard variation?
This is the square root of the variance.

# Z-scores and quantiles

Z-values,and z transformation (z-score,	or standardized	scores) is a super important topic that you will encounter very often, and use very often. Z-scores come	from a	standardized normal	distribution, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation	of	1.

## All the above are descriptive statistics. The first paragragh in a thesis (or results or methods ?) should be the descriptive statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation) as this gives the reader information of the quality of your data.
